# Mapping_Earthquaes

# Introduction 
Our planet is in continuous changes from the start, about 175 millions years ago the continents that we know today where not even close as they are today, this is all 
thanks to the tectonic plates, this are the earth outermost layer or crust and the solid one where we live, being the only one that is totally solid it makes for a 
constant movement below it and this causes our layer to be broken in different pieces. To end up this basic geography class the movement and crashes of the tectonic
plates creates different phenomenon and one of this is earthqueakes, this kind of phenomena can be as sutil or destructive and damage our cities and surroundings, so it 
is something to be worried about, in this challenge I was able to create a map to show you where are the most common ocurrance of earthqueakes and the magntitudes.

# Material and Method
- Javascript
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- Leaflet v.
- D3
- CSS
- MapBox

With help of D3 library I created an API call to 2 different websites (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen) in the first
page you can find the information about all earthquakes around the globe, date, city, magnitude, and other data and in the second there is data about the tectonic
plates saved in a Json file making it easy to work with.

# Result
The resulting map is a convination of 3 maps from mapbox, data from earthquakes, major earthquakes and the tectonic plates so you can choose what to see in them, you
can see that the earthquakes and the tectonic plates have a relation, like I said in the introduction this phenomenon is caused by the friction between the tectonic 
plates so it was to be expected but the major earthquakes happen to be primarily in the Pacific Ocean never the less there is still major earthquakes in the Atlantic or 
nearby, but there is a good point in the Pacific Ocean, there is a structure called the ring of fire or Pacific Rim, this is a big structure full of volcanos that are
still active hence the name (you may have heard of the Krakatoa (1883)) and this is a big reason why most mayor earthquakes. You might think that this movements only 
affect us but you are in the contrary, thanks to this crashes we have mountains and different scenary and different species.
